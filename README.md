# Login Page - Interactive Password Visibility

Welcome to the repository for the Login Page project! This project aims to enhance the user experience of a login page by providing an interactive password visibility feature. Users can easily toggle the visibility of their password by clicking on an eye icon. When the password is visible, the rest of the page fades into the background, ensuring that the user's focus remains solely on the password input. Clicking the eye icon again hides the password, restoring the page's original appearance.

Please note that this project is still a work in progress, and I will continue to refine and improve its functionality in the future.(this is just a fun project)
